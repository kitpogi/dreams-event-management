# Recommendations Improvement Todo List

This document outlines planned and suggested improvements for the Dream Events recommendation system.

## High Priority: AI & Algorithm Enhancements
- [ ] **LLM-Powered Matching**: Integrate Google Gemini API to analyze complex user preference strings and match them semantically with package descriptions.
- [ ] **Smart Budget Flexibility**: Implement "soft" budget constraints that suggest high-value packages slightly above the budget with clear justifications of the added value.
- [ ] **Venue Availability Integration**: Cross-reference recommended packages with real-time venue availability for the user's selected event date.
- [ ] **Explainability Refinement**: Replace static justification strings with dynamic, persuasive natural language explanations generated by AI.

## Medium Priority: Data-Driven Improvements
- [ ] **Collaborative Filtering**: Implement logic to suggest packages that were highly rated or frequently booked by users with similar profiles/preferences.
- [ ] **Admin Scoring Dashboard**: Create an admin interface to adjust the weights of different scoring factors (Category Match, Budget, Capacity, Theme) without redeploying code.
- [ ] **Historical Performance Analysis**: Build a report for admins showing which recommendations were clicked/booked versus those that were ignored.
- [ ] **Seasonal Weighting**: Automatically boost specific package types based on the event date (e.g., boosting indoor venues for rainy seasons).

## Low Priority: User Experience & Features
- [ ] **Interactive Refinement**: Allow users to "Thumbs Up/Down" specific recommendations to instantly recalculate and improve the remaining suggestions.
- [ ] **Waitlist/Quick Quote**: Add a direct "Request Customization" button for recommended packages that don't perfectly fit the user's needs.
- [ ] **Multi-Package Comparison**: Implement a "Compare" view for the top 3 recommendations to highlight differences in inclusions and value.
- [ ] **Preference Evolution Tracking**: Log how user preferences change over time to provide better "long-term" recommendations.

## Technical Tasks
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**: Implement Redis or file-based caching for recommendation results with the same criteria to reduce database load.
- [ ] **Refactor `RecommendationService`**: Break down the large `scorePackages` method into smaller, testable scoring strategies.
- [ ] **Unit Tests for Scoring**: Add comprehensive unit tests for the scoring logic to ensure no regressions when adjusting weights.
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Update Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for the `/recommend` endpoint to include all new parameters.
